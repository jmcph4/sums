Given a text file, `f`, containing space-delimited integers, sum each line of
the file and write it to the corresponding line of an output file, `f.out`.

## Build ##
Just
    make

it's that simple

## Invocation ##
Invoke like so
    ./sums file1 file2 file3

and there will be three files: `file1.out`, `file2.out`, and `file3.out`
created in the same directory.
